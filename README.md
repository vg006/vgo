# 📟 Vgo

## 📝 Overview

Vgo is a simple go project scaffolding tool with user-friendly command-line interface written in Go. It helps developers streamline the creation of Go projects by dynamically generating scaffolding based on user-defined inputs. This tool saves time, ensures consistent project structure, and improves development efficiency.

> **NOTE** : This is my first open source contribution. I hope this tool will be useful to many developers and help them in their projects. I am open to feedback and suggestions to improve this tool further.
This is the first version of the tool and I will be adding more features and improvements in the future.

## 🚀 Demo
![Demo](./demo.gif)

See it is that simple to create a new project with vgo. Just run the command `vgo init` and answer the questions to create a new project.

## ✨ Features

- **Dynamic File Generation**: Creates boilerplate code files tailored to your project.
- **Customizable Templates**: Supports user-defined templates for flexibility.
- **Instant Setup**: Quickly scaffold a new project by leveraging go routines.
- **Cross-Platform**: Runs seamlessly on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

## 🎯 Todo

This is the list of features that I am planning to add in the future. I will be working on these features in the upcoming versions.

- [ ] Add support for custom templates.
- [ ] Improve project structure.
- [ ] Configure project settings using a configuration file.
- [ ] Implement addons features (basic auth, logging, caching and testing setup).
